gridfit.m

	 gridfit: estimates a surface on a 2d grid, based on scattered data
	          Replicates are allowed. All methods extrapolate to the grid
	          boundaries. Gridfit uses a modified ridge estimator to
	          generate the surface, where the bias is toward smoothness.
	 
	          Gridfit is not an interpolant. Its goal is a smooth surface
	          that approximates your data, but allows you to control the
	          amount of smoothing.

	             redundancy in the distances.
