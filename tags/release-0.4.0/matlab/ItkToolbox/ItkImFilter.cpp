/* ItkImFilter.cpp
 *
 * ITK_IMFILTER: Run ITK filter on a 2D or 3D image
 *
 * This MEX function is a multiple-purpose wrapper to be able to run
 * all ITK filters that inherit from itk::ImageToImageFilter on a
 * Matlab 2D image or 3D image volume.
 *
 * B = ITK_IMFILTER(TYPE, A)
 *
 *   TYPE is a string with the filter we want to run. Currently, only
 *   the following options are implemented:
 *
 *     'skel':    (BinaryThinningImageFilter3D) Skeletonize a
 *                binary mask
 *
 *                B has the same size and class as A
 *
 *     'dandist': (DanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter) Compute unsigned
 *                distance map for a binary mask. Distance values are
 *                given in voxel coordinates
 *
 *                B has the same size as A. B has a type large enough
 *                to store the maximum distance in the image. The
 *                largest available type is double. If this is not
 *                enough, a warning message is displayed, and double
 *                is used as the output type
 *
 *     'maudist': (SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter) Compute signed
 *                distance map for a binary mask. Distance values are
 *                given in real world coordinates, if the input image
 *                is given as an NRRD struct, or in voxel units, if
 *                the input image is a normal array. The output type
 *                is always double.
 *
 *   A is a 2D matrix or 3D volume with the image or
 *   segmentation. Currently, A can be of any of the following
 *   Matlab classes:
 *
 *     boolean
 *     double
 *     single
 *     int8
 *     uint8
 *     int16
 *     uint16
 *     int32
 *     int64
 *
 *   A can also be a SCI NRRD struct, A = nrrd, with the following fields:
 *
 *     nrrd.data: 2D or 3D array with the image or segmentation, as above
 *     nrrd.axis: 3x1 struct array with fields:
 *       nnrd.axis.size:    number of voxels in the image
 *       nnrd.axis.spacing: voxel size, image resolution
 *       nnrd.axis.min:     real world coordinates of image origin
 *       nnrd.axis.max:     ignored
 *       nnrd.axis.center:  ignored
 *       nnrd.axis.label:   ignored
 *       nnrd.axis.unit:    ignored
 *
 *   An SCI NRRD struct is the output of Matlab's function
 *   scinrrd_load(), also available from Gerardus.
 *
 *   B has the same size and class as the image in A, and contains the
 *   filtered image or segmentation mask.
 *
 * This function must be compiled before it can be used from Matlab.
 * If Gerardus' root directory is e.g. ~/gerardus, type from a
 * linux shell
 *
 *    $ cd ~/gerardus/matlab
 *    $ mkdir bin
 *    $ cd bin
 *    $ cmake ..
 *    $ make install
 *
 * Cmake has equivalents for Windows and MacOS, but I have not tried
 * them.
 *
 * If cmake throws an error because it cannot find Matlab, then edit
 * gerardus/matlab/CMakeLists.txt, and where it says
 *
 *    SET(MATLAB_ROOT "/usr/local/matlab/R2010b/")
 *
 *  change to your own Matlab root path.
