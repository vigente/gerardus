18.12.04 version 5.1.0.0 released
        This is the first release of this new MATLAB lpsolve driver.
        It uses ideas from the lpmex implementation for lp_solve 2.3 from Jeffrey C. Kantor
        but it was redesigned completely by Peter Notebaert for performance, functionality
        and complete support of the lp_solve 5.1 API.

28.07.05 version 5.5.0.0 released

12.11.05 version 5.5.0.1 released
      - set_outputfile(lp0, ""); added to disable messages on console
      - For routines that return an integer,
        CreateDoubleMatrix and SetDoubleMatrix replaced by CreateLongMatrix and SetLongMatrix

19.11.05 version 5.5.0.2 released
      - For routines that need an lp handle, this handle can now also be the model name.
      - New call get_handle to get handle from model name.

09.03.05 version 5.5.0.3 released
      - When sensitivity is not known (integer models), but requested then a crash occured.
        This is fixed.
