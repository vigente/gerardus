%
%   Special Ordered Sets (SOS):
%       type    - A string containing '1' or '2' for each SOS1 or SOS2 constraint.
%       index   - A double array of the indices of the variables in the SOS,
%                 group multiple SOS index arrays in a cell array.
%       weight  - A double array of the weights of each of the variable
%                 above, indicating variables next to each other. Group 
%                 multiple SOS via cell arrays as above.
%
%   Quadratic Constraints (QC) [qrl <= x'Qx + l'x <= qru]:
%       Q       - A sparse double matrix of the quadratic terms for the
%                 constraint, group multiple quadratic constraints via a
%                 cell array of matrices. [NOT TRIL / TRIU]
%       l       - A column vector of the linear terms for the constraint,
%                 group multiple quadratic constraints in a matrix, each
%                 column representing each constraint.
%       qrl     - A scalar representing the quadratic constraint lower
%                 bound. Group multiple quadratic constraints in a
%                 column vector, each row representing each constraint.
%       qru     - A scalar representing the quadratic constraint upper 
%                 bound. Group multiple quadratic constraints in a
%                 column vector, each row representing each constraint.
%
%   Nonlinear Objective & Constraints (min f(x) and cl <= c(x) <= cu)
%       See opti_scipnl for usage. Contains multiple fields of instructions
%       lists which the MEX interface parses into SCIP expressions.
%
%   * From OPTI v1.78 scip can also solve AMPL .nl models. Simply pass the FULL path
%	  of the AMPL .nl file to scip as the first argument, and options (if requred) as
%	  the second argument. This interface will also write an AMPL solution file to the
%	  same directory as the input file. Remember SCIP does not solve models with 
%	  trigonometric functions.
