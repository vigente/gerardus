	* ExtractVoxelCoordinatesFromSegmentationMask.cxx,
	PadSegmentationMaskWithVoxels.cxx, Resize3DImage.cxx: Add author.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Add comment licence headers.

	* Resize3DImage.cxx: Add comment and licence headers.

	* Delete MbaSurfaceInterpolation.cxx: Test code no longer needed.

2011-03-29  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Add CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE variable so that the code
	is optimized for speed.

2011-03-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* third-party/mba/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Now libMBA.so is installed in matlab/PointsToolbox, so that it's
	in the same directory as the MEX function that makes use of it.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	- Force the gcc and g++ compilers version to be 4.3. This is the
	version that Matlab currently requires, and we have to compile the
	libMBA library with the same version as the MEX file in the matlab
	directory.

2011-03-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* third-party/mba/include/UCButils.h,
	third-party/mba/src/UCButils.cpp:

	- Add UCBspl::printCSVgrid() method so that I can output the
	interpolated grid points to a CSV file that Matlab can read.

	* third-party/mba/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Remove dependencies to OpenGL, that were giving linking problems
	and don't seem to be necessary for mbaSurfaceInterpolation to run. 

	* Add MbaSurfaceInterpolation.cxx:

	- So far, I copied the example provided by the original MBA
	developers, and made some changes for a quick and dirty test of
	the interpolation code. It throws a segmentation fault if you try
	to interpolate outside the square that contains the grid.

2011-03-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Rename third-party/mba/Makefile provided by original developers as
	third-party/mba/Makefile.orginal so that it doesn't interfere with
	files generated by cmake.

	* Add third-party/mba/CMakeLists.txt

	- So that we can use cmake to build the MBA library and integrate
	it with Gerardus, instead of the Makefile provided by the orginal
	developers.

	* Add third-party/mba

	- Directory with the MBA library (SINTEF Multilevel B-spline
	Approximation library - version 1.1), Copyright (C) 2000-2005
	SINTEF ICT, Applied Mathematics, Norway. GPL.

2011-02-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Resize3DImage.cxx

	- Add input argument so that the user can give the Gaussian
	standard deviation in voxel units.

2011-02-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Resize3DImage.cxx

	- Add input arguments to override the automatically computed
	standard deviations for the Gaussian low-pass filtering. This way,
	it's possible to blur more or less. If the std=0, the Gaussian
	filtering is skipped for that coordinate.

2011-02-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CMakeLists.txt

	- Add boost_system to the list of libraries each program has to be
	linked too. I have no idea why linking has been working in the
	past without this.

2010-10-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Resize3DImage.cxx

	- After asking in the ITK user mailing list, Dan Mueller suggested
	using IdentityTransform. I started looking, and found that there's
	actually an example on how to decimate in ITK, in
	Examples/Filtering/SubsampleVolume.cxx. I adapted the code, and
	figured out how to scale the sigma value of the low-pass filter to
	get a similar result to the Resample tool in Seg3D.

2010-07-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add src/Resize3DImage.cxx

	- Start adding program to resize an image volume, trying an
	approach of ScaleTransform to resize the image. This is not
	working very well, because there's no Gaussian filtering, and the
	coordinate frame is changed. I'm going to switch to using
	MultiResolutionPyramidImageFilter, but before I'm commiting the
	code in case I need to roll back.

2010-06-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:

	- Attempt to recompute the image resolution when the image is
	rotated. Imagine we have a 2D image with 1x2 resolution, and
	rotate it 90º. With the current code, the rotated image would
	still have 1x2 resolution, but it would make sense that it changes
	to 2x1. Anyway, I need to test the new code, and have no time now,
	so I'm leaving the code commented out to work on it later.

2010-03-04  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:

	- Reorder input arguments, so that now filename is at the
	end. This way, we can use xargs on the shell and rotate a
	list of files.

	- Major bug fix. Input transformation was all mixed up. Now the
	input transformation is expected to be in the intuitive
	direction. For example, if you want to rotate the volume 30º
	clockwise, your transformation should rotate the Cartesian system
	30º clockwise too.

	- Add input argument to select autocrop, so that the output volume
	will tightly enclose the selected voxels in a segmentation mask,
	or you can also define margins by a percentage.

2010-03-02  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:

	- Add input argument to select the interpolator type. Now we can
	choose between bspline or nearest neighbour. The reason is that
	bspline was giving bad results for binary masks (but works well
	for grayscale images).

2010-02-26  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:

	- Change syntax. Instead of giving the centroid and rotation
	matrix, in that order, we are expecting the (3,4) extended matrix,
	that contains the rotation matrix and a translation vector.

2010-02-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/Rotate3DImage.cxx:

	- Make default background colour 0, and add input argument to be
	able to change it.

2010-01-26  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* src/PadSegmentationMaskWithVoxels.cxx:

	- Remove some redundant lines of code.

2009-11-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add copyright and licence notices.

	* Add README file with list of available programs.

	* Add src/PadSegmentationMaskWithVoxels.cxx.

	- Program to pad the sides of a 3D segmentation mask
	(e.g. produced by Seg3D) with new voxels.

2009-09-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add src/ExtractVoxelCoordinatesFromSegmentationMask.cxx ,
	src/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Program to extract the coordinates of voxels selected in a
	segmentation mask.
