==========================

extractVoxelCoordinatesFromSegmentationMask:

	Program to extract the coordinates of voxels selected in a
	segmentation mask.

padSegmentationMaskWithVoxels:

	Program to pad the sides of a 3D segmentation mask
	(e.g. produced by Seg3D) with new voxels.

resize3DImage:

	Program to resize a 3D image, using low-pass Gaussian
	filtering to decimate it.

rigidRegistration2D:

	Program to align one 2D image to another using a rigid 
	transformation (rotation and translation).

rotate3DImage:

	Program to rotate a 3D image in space

skeletonize3DSegmentation:

	Program to reduce a segmentation to its skeleton.

vesselness3DImage:

	Program to compute the vesselness measure for each voxel of a
