2011-05-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.hpp, DanielssonFilter.hpp,
	NrrdImage.hpp, BaseFilter.cpp, ArgumentParsers.cpp,
	BaseFilter.hpp, ArgumentParsers.hpp, ThinningFilter.hpp,
	SignedMaurerFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.2.0) Big change in architecture. BaseFilter declares the
	filter variable as an ImageToImageFilter, but then it's the
	responsability of each derived filter class to instantiate it in
	its constructor.

	- BaseFilter declares several methods that contain the code to
	load the image, filter it and pass the output to Matlab for a
	plain filter. These methods are virtual, so thanks to polymorphism
	we can override them in the derived filter classes if the filter
	has any special requirements or features.

	- Big thanks to Joe Pitt-Francis, Miguel Bernabeu and Raf Bordas
	for their help and advice that made this architecture change
	possible.

2011-05-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkKernelTransform.cpp:

	- Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp, ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.cpp:

	- Move parser functions to new files.

	- Create member functions for BaseFilter to split the filtering in
	different stages. These functions are virtual, so they can be
	redifined by derived classes to introduce functionality specific
	to each fiter.

	- Remove function SetSpecificParameters(), because now its
	functionality will be part of FilterSetup().

	* Add ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/ArgumentParsers.cpp, CMakeLists.txt:

	- Files to contain the functions that parse the input type
	variables to type templates.

	* ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp, SignedMaurerFilter.hpp:

	- Rename member function SetSpecificParameters() as
	SetSpecificFilterParameters().

	* ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp
	(BaseFilter):

	- (v0.1.1) Remove class FilterParamFactory. Now parameters
	specific to each filter are passed through the derived filter
	classes.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- (v0.3.7) New substantial change in the architecture. Now we have
	a BaseFilter class that implements in its constructor the
	filtering of the Matlab image, as before.

	  But now each filter is a class derived from BaseFilter. So if a
	filter has some specific requirements (input arguments, member
	methods or secondary outputs), we can add code just for it.

	  Besides, because we have moved each filter's code to a .cpp and
	.hpp pair of files, we only need to compile the filter we are
	modifying. Previously, every compilation had to recompile all the
	code.

	* Add ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/SignedMaurerFilter.cpp,
	ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/DanielssonFilter.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.cpp, ItkToolbox/ThinningFilter.hpp

	- Files to hold code that is specific to each filter. Each filter
	is a class derived from BaseFilter. There are two blocks of code
	that we need to put in these files:

	  The EXCLUDEFILTER macros in *.hpp/*.cpp make the compiler
	compile the class with an empty constructor and empty methods, so
	that the filter is not instantiated for not allowed input/output
	types.

	  The FILTERINST macros at the end of *.cpp instantiate the filter
	for valid input/output types. This is necessary to avoid errors
	with the linker. The reason is that templated classes either need
	to be completely defined in the header file (which makes the
	compilation slower and possibly the executable larger), or
	instantiated explicitly, as we are doing. This solution was found
	in the following link

	  http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/templates.html#faq-35.15

	* Delete ItkToolbox/FilterExclusions.cpp:

	- This file is no longer needed. Now the filter exclusions are in
	the new files that are specific to each filter.

2011-05-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (0.3.6) Move some code to ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp.

	* CMakeLists.txt, ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Code has been moved from ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp to the new
	files ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp.

	* Add ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.hpp, ItkToolbox/BaseFilter.cpp:

	- To contain the BaseFilter class and the auxiliary parsing
	functions that map from type variables to type templates. The
	parsers have to be included here because BaseFilter needs to be
	available for them at compile time. Otherwise, the linker doesn't
	know how to link them together. This is a template problem, as
	pointer out by Raf Bordas. The only solutions, he says, are either
	to put the code together, or to use explicit instantiation of
	every template type, but that's what we are trying to avoid,
	because we can have a large number of combinations. The trade off
	for code simplicity is that compilation will be slower.

	* Rename ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp as
	ItkToolbox/FilterExclusions.hpp.

	* ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp:

	- (0.1.1) Pass the number of output arguments from the entry
	mexFunction all the way to the FilterFactory. We are going to need
	it for filters that give more than one output argument.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (0.3.5) Pass the number of output arguments from the entry
	mexFunction all the way to the FilterFactory. We are going to need
	it for filters that give more than one output argument.

	- Rename runTime* functions to parse*, as this describes better
	what they do.

2011-05-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp:

	- We are going to pass the pointer to the array of all output
	arguments instead of just the first output argument to the
	FilterFactory.

	* CMakeLists.txt, FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt,
	ItkToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Move the NrrdImage class to ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.cpp.

	- Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- Move the NrrdImage class to ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp,
	ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.cpp.

	- We are going to pass the pointer to the array of all output
	arguments instead of just the first output argument to the
	FilterFactory.

	* Add ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.hpp, ItkToolbox/NrrdImage.cpp:

	- Create these two files to remove the NrrdImage class from
	ItkImFilter.cpp.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.7.2) Fix bug. Remove small patch of voxels only of we are
	labelling the image.

2011-05-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* All *.m, *.cpp, *.hpp files:

	- Add missing help headers, authour, version, $Rev$ and $Date$, if
	necessary.

	- Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.7.1) In some very particular cases, a small patch of voxels
	may be left unlabelled. We are just going to remove them from the
	segmentation

	- Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp:

	- Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.3.2) Fix bugs. Avoid trying to straighten branches with 1 or
	2 voxels. Deal with the case when the branch produces less than 3
	eigenvalues.

	- Add svn:keywords Date.

	- Maurer distances inside the object are negative by default, so
	we have to convert them to the positive value.

	- Add svn:keywords Rev.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp (FilterParamFactory):

	- (v0.3.4) Add svn:keywords Rev, Date.

	- Make Maurer filter give the output in actual Euclidean
	distances, not squared ones.

2011-05-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

 	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.7.0) Add output field cc.BifurcationPixelIdx.

2011-05-13  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp:

	- (v0.1.0) Add exclusions for SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter.

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- Add SignedMaurerDistanceMapImageFilter to compute signed
	distances in real world coordinates.

	- (v0.3.3) Thanks to a new FilterParamFactory class with explicit
	specialization, we can treat each filter type differently in terms
	of parameters. So e.g. we can run filter->SetAlpha1(0.3) for a
	certain filter type, but don't do it for the rest.

	- (v0.3.2) Move template explicit specialization code to
	ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp, add comments so that the
	code can be well understood and tidy up.

	* Add ItkToolbox/FilterFactoryExclusions.hpp:

	-  This is a file to remove some cluttering from file
	ItkImFilter.cpp. It contains the template explicit specialization
	code that prevents the compiler from trying to instantiate certain
	input/output image types for certain filters.

2011-05-12  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.3.1) Very big internal change in architecture, that doesn't
	change the interface. Now, instead of nesting switch and if
	clauses in mexFunction() to instantiate the different combinations
	of input/output image type, we have created functions that allow
	us to translate from the type variables to type templates. Now we
	can run all filters with one FilterFactory, because types not
	supported by each filter can be explicitely removed from the
	compilation. These changes came after a lengthly discussion with
	Miguel Bernabeu who figured out the problem I had to solve.

	- (v0.3.0) Accept SCI NRRD structs created by scinrrd_load() as
	input, so that we can pass image resolution and offset to the
	filter. This has been a substantial rewrite, because we had to
	create an NrrdImage class to parse the NRRD fields and pass them
	to runFilter().

2011-05-11  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m:

	- (v0.1.0) Add version number and note on help header to make
	clear that nrrd.axis(1) corresponds to rows, not to the
	x-coordinate.

2011-05-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- (v0.2.0) Add DanielssonDistanceMapImageFilter. This basically
	meant creating another runFilter() for the case where the input
	and output images don't have the same type, and some template
	tricks to e.g. be able to test the output image type using the
	templated type. Now it should be very easy to add new filters that
	produce an result with a different type than the input image.

2011-05-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m:

	- (v0.3.1) Don't try to straighten branches that cannot be
	parameterized (at the moment, the only case I can think of are
	branches with loops).

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.6.1) We no longer split up loops, because it doesn't really
	make sense to try to parameterize a loop as a 1-D spline.

2011-05-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.6.0) Add field cc.IsLoop to output.

	- Fix bug. For branches that were a loop not connected to any
	other part of the skeleton, there were no extreme points and this
	gave an error when trying to index an empty array.

2011-05-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m:

	- (v0.5.0) Add fields cc.IsLeaf, cc..BranchLength to output.

	- (v0.4.2) Fix bug. When adding bifurcation points to branches, in
	some cases voxels could get duplicated.

	- (v0.4.1) Fix bug. Branches forming a loop were not correctly
	parameterized. We were choosing an extreme voxel, and then finding
	the furtherst voxel. In a "linear" branch this works fine, but in
	a loop, the furthest voxel is at the other end of the loop, so
	half the loop was being dropped. Now, we break loops open before
	computing Dijkstra, so all the voxels are included.

	* FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.cpp (MexFunction, getNeighbours):
	v0.2.2

	- Fix bug. As the neighbour r, c, s indices we are using a
	mwIndex, that is a long unsigned int. So when we were doing
	rcs[2]-1 and rcs[2]==0, instead of getting -1, the number wrapped
	around due to an implicit cast and gave 18446744073709551615.

	- Fix bug. If res was not provided, we were passing a NULL pointer
	to run(), that gave a segfault.

2011-05-04  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m: v0.3.0

	- SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS Shape stats for each object in a
	multi-label segmentation; objects can be straightened with an
	skeleton or medial line before computing the stats.

	* Delete FiltersToolbox/landlocked_stats.m:

	- Move its functionality to
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m to avoid having different
	functions that do similar things.

2011-05-03  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_squeeze.m: v0.1.2

	- Don't remove dimension from nrrd.axis if it's not a dummy
	dimension.

2011-04-29  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.4.0

	- Replace slow Dijkstra-based labelling of the whole image by new
	very fast region grow algorithm bwregiongrow().

	* FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.m: v0.2.0

	- Remove all Matlab code, that was very slow and inefficient. This
	function is now fully implemented in C++ in the corresponding MEX
	function, that is very fast.

	* FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.cpp: v0.2.1

	- Add input argument maxiter, to limit the number of grow
	iterations of the algorithm.

	* FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt:

	- Rename FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow_aux.cpp as
	FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.cpp.

	* Rename FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow_aux.cpp as
	FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.cpp.

	* FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow_aux.cpp: v0.2.0

	- Complete rewrite of the function. Now instead of implementing
	only a loop of the Matlab function, it implements the whole region
	grow algorithm. We don't need to use a distance matrix, and the
	algorithm is super fast (6 sec with the right.mha image that
	would've probably taken over 35 min with the Dijkstra Matlab
	method, and a lot more with the region grow implemented in Matlab).

2011-04-28  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.m:

	- BWREGIONGROW  Region grow segmentation of binary image from
	multiple seeds.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow_aux.cpp: v0.1.0

	- This is an auxiliary function to bwregiongrow.m, to implement
	part of the algorithm in C++ so that we can avoid a costly loop in
	Matlab.

2011-04-26  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* ItkToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp:

	- Change a type that was int to mwSize, so that it can be compiled
	for 64 bit architectures.

	* matlab/MatlabMakeMacros.cmake:

	- In 64 bit architectures, we need to remove the flag
	-DMX_COMPAT_32 (this is what mex -largeArrayDims does).

	* FiltersToolbox/seg2dmat.m: v0.2.1

	- We were removing voxels not connected to other voxels from the
	dictionary and the distance matrix. This creates all sorts of
	problems with other functions, because when they find an isolated
	voxel, they try to index a non-existent entry in dict or the
	distance matrix.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/bwregiongrow.m: v0.1.0

	- BWREGIONGROW  Region grow segmentation of binary image from
	multiple seeds.

2011-04-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.3.3

	- Use new slow mode in graph_nn() to avoid running out of
	memory. Either method is, however, too slow, with a expected 35
	min to partition a 468x159x475 image with only 16510 skeleton
	voxels.

	* PointToolbox/graph_nn.m: v0.2.0

	- Add new input argument FAST, to choose between running it in
	vectorized mode (faster), or using a loop (less memory).

	- Fix bug. Voxels not connected to the skeleton (min distance =
	Inf) were being assigned skeleton index 1. Now they get NaN.

	- Remove predecessors list, we don't need it, and it needs a lot
	of memory.

2011-04-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Delete matlab/test/bent-vessel-2d.mat

	- Not an image, just some vectors and matrices that are difficult
	to use.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m: v0.2.0

	- Fix bug. Skeleton voxels that are not part of the branch voxels
	need to be added to the branch. This can happen because a labelled
	segmentation voxel can belong only to one object, but a skeleton
	bifurcation voxel can be actually shared by more than one.

	- Big rewrite, tidy up, and remove all the code about
	straightening, that is now under function pts_local_rigid().

	- Remove STRAIGHT input argument, that is now implicit if CC is
	provided.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_local_rigid.m: v0.1.1

	- Fix bug. The rotation and translation was wrong, and it became
	apparent when running the function on the 3D example
	bent-vessel-3d-2.mat. Now the points are correctly translated
	before and after rotation, and the procrustes registration is
	unnecessary within the loop.

2011-04-22  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* update_README.sh:

	- Avod recursing into directories. This avoids that it finds the
	*Toolbox directories in bin/

	* Move itk functions to new ItkToolbox directory

	- FiltersToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp
	- FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt
	- FiltersToolbox/itk_imfilter.m
	- PointsToolbox/ItkKernelTransform.cpp
	- PointsToolbox/CMakeLists.txt
	- PointsToolbox/itk_kernel_transform.m
	- CMakeLists.txt

	* Add new directory ItkToolbox

	* Add FiltersToolbox/ItkImFilter.cpp,
	FiltersToolbox/CMakeLists.txt, FiltersToolbox/itk_imfilter.m:

	- ITK_IMFILTER: Run ITK filter on a 2D or 3D image.

	- This is also a big development in the project, because even
	though this function currently implements only the skeleton
	filter, it is templated so that it can use many of Matlab's matrix
	classes (double, boolean, uint8, etc), and it's generic enough
	that adding new filters should be easy.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	- Build new function itk_imfilter().

2011-04-21  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add some test data to matlab/test

	- bent-vessel-2d.mat
	- veins-tree-blob.mat
	- veins-tree-blob.mha
	- veins-tree-blob-skeleton.mat
	- veins-tree-blob-skeleton.mha

	* Add PointsToolbox/pts_local_rigid.m: v0.1.0

	- PTS_LOCAL_RIGID Non-rigid transformation that is locally rigid
	between two sets of points with known correspondence.

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m: v0.2.1

	- Add default for CHOP input argument.

2011-04-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/landlocked_stats.m: v0.1.0

	- LANDLOCKED_STATS Assess whether sections of voxels are
	surrounded by other sections (land) or by background (water).

	* Add PointsToolbox/ItkKernelTransform.cpp,
	PointsToolbox/itk_kernel_transform.m: v0.1.0

	- ITK_KERNEL_TRANSFORM ITK warps between 3D point sets with a
	known correspondence.

	* Add CMakeLists.txt, PointsToolbox/CMakeLists.txt,
	MatlabMakeMacros.cmake:

	- Cmake files to build PointsToolbox/itk_kernel_transform.mexa64.

	- This is a big development for the project, because now we know
	how to write C++ code with ITK functions, and compile it as a MEX
	file so that we can run it directly from Matlab. Also, we can
	build the files using cmake, and we don't need mex.

2011-04-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_plot.m: v0.2.0

	- Add input arguments varargin so that we can pass extra options
	to the plots.

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m: v0.2.0

	- Add input argument CHOP so that we can deactivate the conversion
	of points outside the image to NaN.

2011-04-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2label_stats.m: v0.1.0

	- SCINRRD_SEG2LABEL_STATS  Shape stats for each label in a
	multi-label segmentation.

	* Rename FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2vesselness.m as
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2voxel_stats.m.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_rotmat.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_ROTMAT Compute rotation matrix to minimize least squares
	error.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_procrustes.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_PROCRUSTES Least-Squares Fit Orthogonal Procrustes Analysis
	between two sets of points.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_procrustes_gen.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_PROCRUSTES_GEN Generalized Least-Squares Fit Orthogonal
	Procrustes Analysis.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_cn.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_CN Center and normalize a set of points.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_simil_map.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_SIMIL_MAP Apply similarity transformation to points.

	* PointsToolbox/pts_simil_map_params.m: v1.0.0

	- PTS_SIMIL_MAP_PARAMS Compute similarity transformation
	parameters between sets of points with unknown
	correspondence (Procrustes is used).

2011-04-13  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/pts_pca.m: v1.1.0

	- Don't chop off small eigenvalues. First, because depending on
	the scaling of the data, a small eigenvalue may actually be
	significant. Second, because small or negative eigenvalues may
	indicate interesting features in the data. Third, because it's
	easy to remove them afterwards if they are creating numerical
	errors in some application.

	* PointsToolbox/coords_from_dist_gower.m: v0.2.0

	- Add collinearity test.

	* Add PointsToolbox/iscollinear.m: v0.1.0

	- ISCOLLINEAR Test to determine whether a set of points are
	collinear.

2011-04-12  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/dmatrix_complete: v0.1.0

	- DMATRIX_COMPLETE Fill in empty elements of non-Euclidean
	distance matrix.

	* PointsToolbox/dmatrix2coords.m: v0.1.0

	- DMATRIX2COORDS Point coordinates from distance matrix.

	* PointsToolbox/plot_dmatrix.m: v0.1.1

	- Plot vertices as disconnected dots, so that their connections
	don't get confused with distance matrix connetions.

2011-04-11  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.3.2

	- Add PixelParam field to CC output, with the parameterization
	value for each branch voxel computed as the accumulated chord
	distance between consecutive voxels.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/skeleton_plot.m: v0.1.0

	- SKELETON_PLOT Plot a labelled segmentation and its skeleton.

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.3.1

	- Add as output arguments skeleton distance matrix, and
	dictionaries to convert between image and distance matrix indices.

	- Now voxels in each branch are sorted, so that we can walk from
	one termination point to the other without "jumps".

2011-04-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.2.2

	- Add bifurcation points to every branch they terminate. This way,
	it will be easier to sort the points in the branch, as we will
	have 2 termination points (leaf/bifurcation or
	bifurcation/bifurcation) in every branch.

2011-04-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.2.1

	- Fix bug. Instead of adding the bifurcation voxel, we were adding
	its neighbour.

	- Add input arguments so that besides the skeleton, we can pass
	the original segmentation. Now, the whole segmentation and not
	only the skeleton will get labelled.

	* Add matlab/test/veins-tree.mat, matlab/test/veins-tree.mha:

	- To test the new functionality in skeleton_label().

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_squeeze.m: v0.1.1

	- Fix bug. Remove dummy dimension also when nrrd.data has only 3
	dimensions. If you have a single slice, Seg3D saves it with a
	3-dimensional matrix (with a first dummy dimension), but 4
	elements for the nrrd.axis. So this function was working wrong for
	1-slice volumes.

	* Add PointToolbox/graph_nn.m: v0.1.0

	- GRAPH_NN Nearest neighbours from a subset of nodes in a graph to
	another subset.

2011-04-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add test/veins-tree-skeleton.mat, test/veins-tree-skeleton.mha:

	- A 2D segmentation that looks like a tree of veins (with a
	cycle), to test skeleton_label().

	* Add test directory.

	- Directory to keep data and scripts for tests.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/skeleton_label.m: v0.1.0

	- SKELETON_LABEL Give each branch of a skeleton a different label.

2011-04-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/seg2dmat.m: v0.2.0

	- Add input variable for voxel size different from [1 1 1].

	- Add input flag to create a smaller output matrix, but indexing
	only the segmented voxels of the image, not all the voxels in the
	image.

	* Rename img_adjacency_distance.m as im2imat.m.

	* Rename img_adjacency_distance.cpp as im2imat.cpp.

	* FiltersToolbox/img_adjacency_distance.m: v0.1.1

	- Small rewrite of help header to make it more consistent with new
	function seg2dmat.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/seg2dmat.m: v0.1.0

	- SEG2DMAT Local neighbourhood distance matrix between
	segmentation voxels.

2011-04-05  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_seg2vesselness.m: v0.1.0

	- SCINRRD_SEG2VESSELNESS Vesselness parameters from a segmentation
	mask.

	* PointsToolbox/plotaxes.m: v0.2.0

	- Add varargin to be able to pass extra arguments to the plot
	function.

2011-03-22  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/surface_interpolation.m: v0.1.2

	- Add 'mbae' interpolation: Like the 'mba' method, but first a
	thin-plate spline is used to extrapolate values on the
	interpolation domain boundary. Then MBA is used for the local
	support interpolation of X and the boundary values set by the
	thin-plate spline.

2011-03-21  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_surface_interpolation.m:

	- Remove the surface interpolation code to create new function
	CardiacToolbox/surface_interpolation.m.

	* Add CardiacToolbox/surface_interpolation.m:

	- SURFACE_INTERPOLATION Interpolate a surface from a scattered set
	of points.

	- Create this fuction from part of the code in
	CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_surface_interpolation.m. It didn't make
	sense to have all that code depending on using SCI volumes.

	* Rename CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_valve_surface.m as
	PointsToolbox/scinrrd_surface_interpolation.

	- As this is a function for general surface interpolation, it
	doesn't make much sense to give it such an specific name as
	"vale_surface".

	* README

	- First time the README file is automatically generated by
	update_README.sh. From now on, we will not point the updates in
	the ChangeLog, but they will be part of changes to the toolboxes.

	* Add update_README.sh:

	- Script to automatically extract the summary of the help headers
	of all the Matlab functions in this toolbox, and generate a README
	file.

2011-03-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m: v0.2

	- Add input argument v73, a flag to save to v7.3 format, so that
	we can save volumes larger than 2GB.

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_valve_surface.m: v0.3

	- Add new otions to header file.

	- Add 'mba' interpolation, that makes use of the new MEX-file
	mba_surface_interpolation.cpp to provide Multilevel B-Spline
	Approximation interpolation.

	-Use 'natural' option for TriScatteredInterp(), so that the
	interpolant is smoother.

	* Add matlab/PointsToolbox/mba_surface_interpolation.cpp,
	matlab/PointsToolbox/mba_surface_interpolation.m:

	- MBA_SURFACE_INTERPOLATION Scattered data Multilevel B-spline
	interpolation.

2011-03-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add engopts.sh:

	- Matlab's configuration file modified so that we can compile and
	link PointsToolbox/mba_surface_interpolation doing

	>> mex -v -largeArrayDims -outdir PointsToolbox/ -f ./engopts.sh PointsToolbox/mba_surface_interpolation.cpp

2011-03-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_valve_surface.m: v0.2

	- Add 'gridfit' option to interpolate (actually, approximate)
	using John D'Errico's gridfit() function.

	- Add 'tsi' option to interpolate using Matlab's
	TriScatteredInterp() function.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/gridfit.m: v2.0

	- By John D'Errico

	- estimates a surface on a 2d grid, based on scattered data
	Replicates are allowed. All methods extrapolate to the grid
	boundaries. Gridfit uses a modified ridge estimator to generate
	the surface, where the bias is toward smoothness.

        Gridfit is not an interpolant. Its goal is a smooth surface that
	approximates your data, but allows you to control the amount of
	smoothing.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/L2_distance.m

	- L2_DISTANCE - computes Euclidean distance matrix

	- By Roland Bunschoten

	- Requirement of the isomap functions.

2011-03-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/Isomap.m, ThirdPartyToolbox/IsomapII.m

	- Add modified code from Josh Tenenbaum, to compute Isomap
	embedding using an advanced version of the algorithm in Tenenbaum,
	de Silva, and Langford (2000), which can take advantage of
	sparsity in the graph and redundancy in the distances.

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_valve_surface.m: v0.1

	- Add Isomap function to compute interpolation domain.

	- Rewrite the function to be able to use different methods to
	compute the interpolation domain, use different interpolants and
	the factor for the interpolation domain size.

	- Correct the way the interpolation is computed for the PCA
	method. I was rotating the horizontal domain, interpolation and
	rotating back, but this is incorrect because it does not give you
	the same point.

2011-03-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/dmatrix.m: v3.0

	- Fix copyright notice to be uniform with the rest of Gerardus.

	- Add input argument METHOD to select other distances than
	Euclidean.

	* Add PointsToolbox/plot_dmatrix.m

	- PLOT_DMATRIX Plot the connections implied by a distance matrix.

2011-02-24  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m

	- Rename the input argument nrrd to scirunnrrd so that we don't
	need to duplicate the memory.

	- Add output argument nrrd to give the reformatted data volume
	actually saved.

	- Undo last change. The flag -v7.3 is not necessary, and prevents
	Seg3D from loading the segmentations. I think the problem was that
	if Matlab runs out of memory while trying to save the NRRD volume,
	it gives the flag -v7.3 error.

2011-02-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

 	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m

	- Force saving with flag -v7.3 to avoid warning message.

2011-02-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/pts_tps_map.m v6.4

	- Remove whitespace before or after bracket.

	- Fix bug. A bad testing condition prevented the computation of
	interpolated points apart from the first one in the SLOW mode.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- Add input argument to switch between fast (and more memory
	consuming) and slow thin-plate spline interpolation.

	- Fix bug, force scaling factor to be a 3-vector so that it can be
	different in each coordinate.

	- Clear memory as it's no longer needed, so that we can process
	bigger images.

	- Add sigma as output argument so that we now how many voxels we
	are using to low-pass filter the image.

2011-02-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* README

	- Add entry for img_tps_map

2011-02-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* README

	- Add some function names and descriptions that I had forgotten.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/img_tps_map.m

	- IMG_TPS_MAP Warp an image using a thin-plate spline
	transformation

2011-02-03  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- Now the standard deviation necessary to prevent aliasing is
	computed based on proper formulas, instead of guessing. Notes
	about the computations have been added to the help header.

	- Add input argument sigma to force bandwidth of Gaussian filter.

	- Fix bug, the number of rows and columns were swapped, so that
	after reshaping the interpolated intensity vector, the voxels were
	in the wrong place.

2011-01-31  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/pts_tps_weights.m from svn://edison.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ramc/rcasero/matlab-toolbox/pts/trunk/pts_tps_weights.m

	PTS_TPS_WEIGHTS  Compute weights and affine parameters of
	thin-plate spline warp for N-dimensional points

	This function is a dependency that I had forgotten for
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m.

	* Add PointsToolbox/pts_tps_map.m from
	svn://edison.comlab.ox.ac.uk/ramc/rcasero/matlab-toolbox/pts/trunk/pts_tps_map.m

	PTS_TPS_MAP Interpolate/warp/map N-dimensional points using a
	thin-plate spline transformation

	This function is a dependency that I had forgotten for
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- Make function a lot faster, especially with large images.

	Instead of low-pass filtering the image, reducing the size and
	sampling the background points, now we sample the background
	points and a region around them, and low-pass filter only the
	voxels of interest.

2011-01-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- Add low-pass anti-aliasing filter before downsampling
	image. Make it optative, in case filtering is too slow.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/fspecial3.m

	- FSPECIAL3  Create predefined 3-dimensional filters.

2011-01-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- Add input argument to select prescaling. Because using the TPS
	to interpolate all voxels can be rather slow, and the bias field
	is anyway a slow varying field, it's convenient to first quickly
	reduce the image size by A (using bilinear interpolation),
	interpolate the bias field in the smaller image with the TPS, and
	then expand to the original size. By default, A = 1.0 and no
	rescaling is used.

2011-01-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_estimate_bias_field.m

	- SCINRRD_ESTIMATE_BIAS_FIELD  Estimate MRI bias field.

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_index2world.m,
	FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m

	- The way indices and coordinates were computed was wrong. Offset
	gives the coordinates of the first voxel's vertex, not the voxel's
	centre. Now integer indices correspond to the voxels' centres.

2010-12-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_index2world.m,
	FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m

	- Roll back last change, it was not a bug. Rewrite help header to
	clarify the coordinate and index order.

2010-12-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_index2world.m,
	FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m

	- Fix bug. The x,y coordinates (and, correspondingly, the j, i
	indices) were being operated with the wrong spacing and limit
	values. For example, the x-coordinate was being operated with the
	dy spacing. Now this has been fixed.

2010-07-05  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m

	- Give error if the data is compressed.

	- If ElementDatafile is LOCAL, then raw data is in the file, not
	an external one.

2010-07-01  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m

	- Add input argument to control whether data is converted to uint8
	or not before saving.

	* CardiacToolbox/process_misas_patient.m

	- if we have two NormalMri volumes, combine them with a max()
	function to remove banding artifacts, as suggested by Matt Robson

2010-06-30  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* release 0.2.1

	- New minor release given that the bug in WriteRawFile.m and
	WriteMhaFile.m was quite severe, and the new scinrrd_load()
	functionality is interesting.

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m

	- Now this function can also load an nrrd struct from MetaImage
	(.mha) files, and not only Matlab (.mat). This should save us from
	a lot of time wasted having to load .mha files in Seg3D and
	exported as .mat.

2010-06-28  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/WriteRawFile.m,
	FileFormatToolbox/WriteMhaFile.m

	- Fix bug. DICOM frames are loaded into Matlab with X-coordinates
	along columns, but they were written along rows, so the image
	volume was rotated 90º.

2010-06-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_rv_crescent_tips.m

	- Instead of assigning the top and botton of the crest to the last
	and first axis points, just compute from each slice the closest
	axis point. Now there is no need for the axis and the right
	ventricle to have the same number of slices.

2010-06-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_valve_surface.m.

	- Inter atrio-ventricular surface.

2010-06-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/crest_envelope.m:

	- Compute the envelope for the Right Ventricle's crest.

2010-05-28  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/process_misas_patient.m

	- Remove assumption that subdirectories with IMA files are called
	MISAS*. We need this because Jason will rename the MISAS*
	directories to NormalMri1, FatMri1, etc. before running this
	script.

2010-05-27  Ramon Casero  <ramc@clpc444.comlab>

	* Add CardiacToolbox/process_misas_patient.m

	- Create MetaImage volumes from directory tree of IMA DICOM files,
	for project with human hearts provided by Kelvin Wong.

	* FileFormatToolbox/sortdirbynum.m:

	- Fix bug. Exit gracefully when list of input files is empty.

2010-05-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add CardiacToolbox/correct_rv_crescent_tips.m

	- Correct the segmentation of the Right Ventricle's crescent tips
	using the segmentation of the tricuspid and pulmonary annula.

2010-05-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_rv_crescent_tips.m

	- Extend computation of the RV crescent tips to the RV slices that
	have no corresponding centroid. In that case the first and last
	centroids in the LV axis are used.

2010-05-12  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/coords_from_dist_gower.m

	- Compute point coordinates from distances to a set of landmarks,
	as described in Gower (1986).
	
2010-05-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/WriteMhaFile.m

	- Fix bug, wrong variable name and function in error message.

	* FileFormatToolbox/dcm2metaimage.m

	- Fix bug when directory in path is the current one.

	* Add PointsToolbox/dmatrix.m

	- Matrix of distances between vectors. Move from Comlab
	repository, matlab-toolbox/misc/trunk.

2010-04-30  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/dcm2metaimage.m:

	- Fix bug with dir name when data is in the current directory.

2010-04-29  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_gradients.m:

	- Vicente suggested using an explicit formula with a 3x3
	neighbourhood to compute the second order gradients, instead of
	running function gradient() twice (which uses a 5x5 neighbourhood).

2010-03-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/dijkstra.cpp:

	- Nodes not connected to the source get a NaN as parent. They were
	getting a 1, which is a bug. By making it NaN, it also mimics the
	output of Matlog Toolbox's function dijk(), that has a native
	Matlab implementation of the same algorithm.

	* Add CardiacToolbox/scinrrd_rv_crescent_tips.m:

	- Extract the tips of the crescent-shaped curve in all slices of
	the Right Ventricle.

	* Add CardiacToolbox/is_lv_on_the_left.m:

	- Check whether the left ventricle is on the left hand side of the
	image.

	* Add CardiacToolbox subdirectory for functions that are specific
	to cardiac image processing.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/dijkstra.m,
	ThirdPartyToolbox/dijkstra.cpp, ThirdPartyToolbox/fibheap.h:

	- DIJKSTRA Shortests path tree from sparse matrix graph.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox/LICENCE

	- To explan licence difference of files in this subdirectory.

	* Add ThirdPartyToolbox directory for derivative works or third
	party functions that cannot be covered by the GPL used elsewhere
	in Gerardus, or code with an uncertain licence status.

	* FiltersToolbox/img_adjacency_distance.m:

	- Add Matlab implementation of the function, to compare with the
	MEX implementation.

2010-03-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/img_adjacency_distance.cpp,
	FiltersToolbox/img_adjacency_distance.m:

	- Convert image to adjacency-distance list in sparse matrix form.

	* Add PointsToolbox/sparse_breakdown.cpp,
	PointsToolbox/sparse_breakdown.m:

	- Extract internal arrays from sparse matrix.

2010-03-10  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_gradients.m:

	- Compute 1st and 2nd order image gradients.

2010-03-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_centroids.m:

	- Instead of skipping them, make [NaN NaN NaN] centroid for empty
	slices too. This way, it's easier to use them in other functions
	that iterate all the slices in a volume.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_centroids.m:

	- Compute centroid of every slice with segmented pixels.

2010-03-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/extmat2rotmat.m, PointsToolbox/rotmat2extmat.m:

	- Remove rounding of index values to allow for continuous
	indices. This way, numerical errors are reduced. In case we need
	integer indices, it's very easy to run round(idx) on the output.

	- Rename argument axis as ax, to avoid clash with function axis().

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_regionprops.m:

	- SCINRRD_REGIONPROPS Measure properties of image regions on each
	slice.

2010-03-05  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/extmat2rotmat.m, PointsToolbox/rotmat2extmat.m:

	- Add input argument "center", so that we can choose the
	transformation A(X-M) instead of A(X-M)+M. This will center the
	heart around the origin of coordinates, and it also allows to use
	a well-conditioned system to be used in extmat2rotmat.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_vertical_orientation_pca_basis.m:

	- Remove input argument "type". We are computing an orientation
	basis, not a rotation matrix, so there's no point in having "type"
	to select between A or A'.

	* Rename scinrrd_vertical_rot3.m as
	scinrrd_vertical_orientation_pca_basis.m:

	- We are computing the orientation basis, not a rotation matrix.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_vertical_rot3.m:

	- Make sure that the orientation of the resulting basis is the
	same as the Cartesian system. 

	The problem is that the basis is valid if we take the negative of
	any of its vectors too. For example, the Cartesian system has
	positive orientation because [1 0 0] x [0 1 0] = [0 0 1]. But
	scinrrd_vertical_rot3() could also produce the basis with negative
	orientation [-1 0 0], [0 1 0], [0 0 1].

	To avoid this, we make sure that the "Z" vector is going up,
	and then change the sign of "X", if necessary.

2010-03-04  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add CardiacToolbox, a directory to keep functions that are only
	relevant to cardiac image processing.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_papillary_muscles.m:

	- Extract the papillay muscles from a segmentation of the Left
	Ventricle's cavity.

	* Add FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_save.m:

	- SCINRRD_SAVE Save a NRRD struct to a Matlab format that can be
	imported by Seg3D.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_unsqueeze.m:

	- SCINRRD_UNSQUEEZE  Add dummy dimension and convert data to uint8
	data type.

	* Add FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_load.m:

	- SCINRRD_LOAD Load a NRRD struct saved to Matlab format.

2010-02-26  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* PointsToolbox/extmat2rotmat.m, PointsToolbox/rotmat2extmat.m:

	- Remove the bottom row of the extended matrix.

2010-02-25  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/extmat2rotmat.m:

	- EXTMAT2ROTMAT Convert rotation in extended matrix form into
	centroid and matrix pair.

	* Add PointsToolbox/rotmat2extmat.m:

	- ROTMAT2EXTMAT  Convert centroid and rotation matrix pair to
	extended matrix form.

2010-02-22  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add PointsToolbox/intersect_line_plane.m:

	- INTERSECT_LINE_PLANE Find intersection of a line with a plane.

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_box.m:

	- SCINRRD_BOX Compute tight box around SCI NRRD segmentation.

2010-02-20  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Interface change: Change input arguments.

	- Now, instead of intering RAD for smoothing of the segmentation,
	we enter a struct called param, that contains new options for the
	optimisation.

	- Added global optimisation, that is, instead of using fminsearch,
	now you can sweep a whole range of azimuth and elevation angles to
	compute the area values. Because we are optimising only two
	variables, this is not much slower than using fminsearch, and it
	provides a much better insight into the results.

	* PointsToolbox/vec2rotmat.m:

	- Add input argument so that an initial guess for the 2 vectors
	orthogonal to V is provided (as part of an initial guess for the
	rotation matrix). This will constrain the infinite space of
	possible rotations to the closest one to the one we had.

2010-02-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_index2world.m,
	FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_world2index.m:

	- Real world coordinates are to be presented as (x,y,z), while
	indices are to be presented as (r,c,s). But note that x <-> c, and
	y <-> r.

	* PointsToolbox/scinrrd_pca.m:

	- Fix bug: The convention has to be that rows are y-coordinates,
	and columns are x-coordinates.

	* PointsToolbox/plotaxes.m:

	- Add input argument for the origin of coordinates.

2010-02-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Remove unnecessary function nesting.

2010-02-17  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Interface change: Change argument order.

	- Now instead of computing a rotation centroid at 2/3 of the
	volume, the user enters the rotation centroid.

	- The rotation centroid stays fixed and is not recomputed at each
	iteration of the optimisation algorithm (actually it is, for
	tracking purposes, but the value used is the initial).

	- Remove big block to compute the instersection area at iteration
	zero, as this can be now done within the optimisation loop.

	- Optimise the azimuth and elevation angles of the normal vector,
	instead of the 3 coordinates of the vector.

	- Use new vec2rotmat() function to compute rotation matrix from
	the normal vector.

	* Add PointsToolbox/vec2rotmat.m:

	- VEC2ROTMAT Compute rotation matrix from Cartesian vector.

	* Add PointsToolbox/plotaxes.m:

	- PLOTAXES Plot axes of 3D coordinate system.

2010-02-15  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scirunnrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Undo change of vector arguments to matrices, because we can do
	the optimisation on the sole vector, and then recompute the
	rotation matrix.

	But keep renaming of function being used by this function.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_intersect_plane.m:

	- Force NRRD data to be double, otherwise interpolation for the
	intersection doesn't work.

	* PointsToolbox/scinrrd_pca.m:

	- Remove assumption that NRRD will have dummy dimension, because
	it could have been removed by a previous scinrrd function.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_vertical_rot3.m:

	- Replace code block by scinrrd_vertical_rot3().

	- Add input argument so that you can select whether the rotation
	is forwards or backwards.

	* PointsToolbox/scinrrd_pca.m:

	- Compute centroid as output argument.

	* Rename scirunnrrd_world2index.m as
	scinrrd_world2index.m. Correct variables and help header for
	consistency with the rest of scinnrd functions.

	* Rename scirunnrrd_index2world.m as
	scinrrd_index2world.m. Correct variables and help header for
	consistency with the rest of scinnrd functions.

	* Rename scirunnrrd_pca.m as scinrrd_pca.m. Correct variables and
	help header for consistency with the rest of scinnrd functions.

	* Rename scirunnrrd_vertical_rot3.m as
	scinrrd_vertical_rot3. Correct help header. Correct variables and
	help header for consistency with the rest of scinnrd functions.

2010-02-09  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Rename FiltersToolbox/scirunnrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m as
	FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_intersect_plane.m:

	- When sampling with interpn(), it is necessary to provide the
	grid matrices in the same order as they are generated by ndgrid().

	* Add FileFormatToolbox/scinrrd_seg3d2matlab.m:

	- SCINRRD_SEG3D2MATLAB Correct dimensions of data loaded from SCI
	NRRD so that rows and columns will follow Matlab's coordinates.

	* FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_ndgrid.m:

	- Fix bug. Limits for x-coordinates were used for y-coordinates
	and viceversa.

2010-02-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scirunnrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Remove temporal code. Add avals, vvals, mvals as output
	arguments to monitor evolution of optimisation algorithm. Add v0,
	rad as input arguments, so that the initial vector is not hard
	coded, and radius of smoothing operators.

2010-02-07  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FiltersToolbox/scirunnrrd_optimal_intersecting_plane.m:

	- Remove quaternions and use the normal vector to the plane as
	optimization variable. The function has some debugging code, it's
	still in development. The optimisation is getting trapped in local
	minima; it's not clear whether this is because of the
	trabeculations, or because the normal vector is not a good
	parameter to optimise.

2010-02-06  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FiltersToolbox/scinrrd_intersect_plane.m:

	thesis at the Wolfson Medical Vision Laboratory, University of
	Oxford (2007-06-09 15:27:07 +0100).

2009-12-08  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* FileFormatToolbox/dcm2metaimage.m:

	- Read the resolution values from the DICOM header, if possible.

	* FileFormatToolbox/dcm2mat.m:

	- In case of a time series, we assume that all frames for slice 1
	are in consecutive DICOM files. Then all the frames for slice 2,
	and so on.

	Note that the output matrix is permuted to have the indices in the
	order (I,J,N,F), where N is the slice index and F is the frame
	index.

	necessary.

	- If output filename is empty, call it 'im.mat'.

2009-11-23  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add FileFormatToolbox/dcm2mat.m:

	- Read a batch of DICOM files, collate them and save as a single
	volume in a .mat file.

	* Add PointsToolbox for functions that deal with points.

	* Create directories for FileFormatToolbox and FiltersToolbox, and
	split existing functions accordingly. As more functions are added
	to the project, we'll need to organize them anyway.

2009-07-16  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* First public release to project Gerardus in Google Code of this
	Matlab Toolbox.

	- http://code.google.com/p/gerardus

	* Add README with help for functions in the Toolbox.

	* WriteMetaFile.h -> WriteRawFile.h:

	- Correct name, as "Meta" could refer to MetaImage, the format
	that includes both the mha header and the raw file.

	* dcm2metadata.m -> dcm2metaimage.m, im2metadata.m ->
	im2metaimage.m:

	Correct filenames and function names, because we are create
	MetaImage files, not "metadata".

	- MATLAB2VOX_SEG3D Convert Matlab file with Seg3D segmentation to
	vox format (for the Tarantula meshing application).

2009-03-18  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	before saving.

	* WriteMhaFile.m:

	- Add help comments.

	- Write 'Offset' line to file, so that cropped data is correctly
	placed.

2009-01-19  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* WriteMhaFile.m, WriteMetaFile.m:

	is not reported, and then Seg3D (and possibly other image
	visualisation applications) will fail to open the file.

2009-01-14  Ramon Casero  <ramon.casero@comlab.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add files provided by Martin Bishop to write metadata
	files. These files were actually created originally by Vicente
	Grau.
