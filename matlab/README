IcosahedronMesh.m

ParticleSampleSphere.m

	 Create an approximately uniform triangular tessellation of the unit 
	 sphere by minimizing generalized electrostatic potential energy 
	 (aka Reisz s-energy) of the system of charged particles. Effectively, 
	 this function produces a locally optimal solution to the problem that 
	 involves finding a minimum Reisz s-energy configuration of N equal 
	 charges confined to the surface of the unit sphere (s=1 corresponds to 
	 the problem originally posed by J. J. Thomson). 
	
RandSampleSphere.m

	 Generate a uniform or stratified sampling of a unit sphere.
	
SubdivideSphericalMesh.m

	 Subdivide triangular mesh representing the surface of the unit sphere
	 k times using triangular quadrisection (see function TriQuad for more 
	 info). The newly inserted vertices are re-projected onto the unit sphere
	 after every iteration.
	
TriQuad.m

	 Subdivide triangular mesh using triangular quadrisection. During this
	 operation new vertices are inserted at the edge midpoints thereby 
	 producing four new faces for every face of the original mesh.

	                     x3                        x3
