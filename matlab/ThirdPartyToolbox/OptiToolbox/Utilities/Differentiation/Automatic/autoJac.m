function jac = autoJac(fun,x0,varargin)
%AUTOJAC  Returns a Automatically Differentiated (AD) Jacobian
% 
%   jac = autoJac(fun,x0) uses the user supplied Matlab function to
%   generate the Jacobian using automatic differentiation. The user
%   function must be a Matlab function and must not call external code or
%   class / toolbox functions. If your function breaks any of these
%   conditions consider using mklJac instead.
%
%   The underlying AD algorithm is adiff by William McIlhagga and its
%   documentation pdf is provided in the Differentiation folder. See the
%   BSD license below the code.
